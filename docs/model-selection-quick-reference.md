## üîç Understanding the Metadata

### Context Window
- **What**: Maximum total tokens (input + output) the model can process
- **Why it matters**: Long conversations + large GeoJSON + tool schemas need space
- **Range**: 32K (basic) to 1M (Gemini)
- **Rule of thumb**: 128K+ is comfortable for most geospatial work

### Tool Calling Quality
- **"Excellent"**: Rarely makes mistakes, handles complex schemas well
- **"Good"**: Reliable for most use cases, occasional errors on edge cases
- **"Basic"**: Works for simple tools, struggles with complex parameters
- **"None"**: Does not support function calling

### Reasoning Capability
- **"Expert"**: Handles complex multi-step spatial reasoning, self-correction
- **"Advanced"**: Good for most geospatial queries, reliable planning
- **"Intermediate"**: Suitable for straightforward tasks, limited planning
- **"Basic"**: Simple queries only, minimal reasoning depth

### Parallel Tool Calls
- **True**: Can call multiple tools in one response (e.g., "find hospitals AND schools")
- **False**: Calls tools sequentially (slower but sometimes more predictable)

## üéØ Use Case Recommendations

### "Find hospitals near rivers in protected areas"
**Recommended**: GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, or Mistral Large
- **Why**: Multi-step reasoning (expert/advanced), excellent tool calling
- **Budget option**: Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp (FREE) or DeepSeek Reasoner ($0.55/M)

### "Load this 10MB GeoJSON and analyze biodiversity"
**Recommended**: Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash (1M context window)
- **Why**: Can fit entire dataset in context, no chunking needed
- **Alternative**: GPT-5 series (200K context) if dataset compresses well

### "Show me hospitals in Berlin"
**Recommended**: DeepSeek Chat, GPT-4o-mini, or GPT-5 Nano
- **Why**: Simple query, intermediate reasoning sufficient, low cost
- **Note**: Any model with "good" or better tool calling will work

### High-volume production API (1000s of requests/day)
**Recommended**: DeepSeek Chat or Gemini 1.5 Flash
- **Why**: Ultra-low cost ($0.14/M and $0.075/M respectively)
- **Check**: Rate limits and latency requirements

### Development/Testing (don't want to pay)
**Recommended**: Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp
- **Why**: FREE during experimental period
- **Capabilities**: Expert reasoning, excellent tools, 1M context
- **Note**: May have rate limits or stability issues

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

1. **Use parallel tool calls when possible**: 89.7% of models support it
2. **Match context window to needs**: Don't pay for 1M tokens if you only need 32K
3. **Consider token counting**: Input + output + tools must fit in context window
4. **Cache when possible**: Some models offer cache cost discounts
5. **Test with cheaper models first**: Validate approach before using premium models

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ‚ùå **Using "basic" tool calling models for complex operations**
   - Use "good" or "excellent" quality for production

2. ‚ùå **Choosing models with insufficient context windows**
   - Large GeoJSON files need 128K+ context
   - Multi-turn conversations accumulate quickly

3. ‚ùå **Ignoring reasoning capability for complex queries**
   - "Intermediate" models struggle with multi-step spatial reasoning
   - Use "advanced" or "expert" for complex analysis

4. ‚ùå **Not considering free alternatives**
   - Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp is FREE and has expert-level capabilities

5. ‚ùå **Overlooking DeepSeek for high volume**
   - At $0.14/M, it's 18x cheaper than GPT-4o for simple queries
